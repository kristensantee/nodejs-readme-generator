## Overview
This project utilizes command-line prompts to generate a properly formatted and outfitted README.md file for a user to attach to an application.

## Description
This README Generator is responsive to command-line prompts that are input by a user for a given project. The prompts will create variables that will be included in a newly generated, professional, and robust README.md file that shares the name of the project. User inputs – including contact links and a screenshot image – will also be prompted and included in the README.
